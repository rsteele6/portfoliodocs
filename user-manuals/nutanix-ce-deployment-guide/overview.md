# 1. Overview

Nutanix Community Edition is a free version of Nutanix’s Acropolis Operating System (AOS), which runs Nutanix’s Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) platform. Community Edition consists of the following components:

* The Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV), a type 1 hypervisor which runs user virtual machines (VMs) as well as the Nutanix Controller VM (CVM).
* The Prism Element web console, a redundant management interface that runs on each hardware node in the Nutanix cluster.

While the paid version of Nutanix comes installed on certified hardware guaranteed for production use in the enterprise, Community Edition is installed by the customer on bare metal servers they already have.

Community Edition is appropriate for customers who:

* would like to try Nutanix before committing to a major purchase.
* intend to use Nutanix in a test/dev environment.

Community Edition is NOT intended for production use! Ensure that customers understand that they will not get enterprise-level performance from Community Edition installed on their own hardware.
