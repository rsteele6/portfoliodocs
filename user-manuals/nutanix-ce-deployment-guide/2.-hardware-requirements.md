If you use a USB flash device as your boot drive, do not remove it while the server is running!

#### 2.1   Cluster Sizing

Community Edition supports up to four (4) nodes in a single cluster. Nutanix recommends deploying a three-node cluster to reap the most benefit from the platform. If you deploy a single node cluster, you will not be able to take advantage of Nutanix’s high-availability (HA) features.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is not possible to extend a one or two node cluster. Moving from a one or two-node cluster requires destroying the existing cluster and all VMs.

Discuss these limitations with the customer before recommending a cluster size.
